Your blades are sharpened with precision
Flashing your favorite point of view
I know you're waiting in the distance
Just like you always do, just like you always do

Already pullin' me in
Already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends, I

Let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don't know why I'm hopin' for what I won't receive
Fallin' for the promise of the emptiness machine
The emptiness machine

Goin' around like a revolver
It's been decided how we lose
'Cause there's a fire under the altar
I keep on lyin' to, I keep on lyin' to

Already pullin' me in
Already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends, I

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don't know why I'm hopin' for what I won't receive
Fallin' for the promise of the emptiness machine

I only wanted to be part of somethin'
I only wanted to be part of, part of
I only wanted to be part of somethin'
I only wanted to be part of, part of
I only wanted to be part of somethin'
I only wanted to be part

I let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don't know why I'm hopin', so fuckin' naive
Fallin' for the promise of the emptiness machine
The emptiness machine

(I only wanted to be part of somethin')
The emptiness machine, oh
(I only wanted to be part of)
The emptiness machine
